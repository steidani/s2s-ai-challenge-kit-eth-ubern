# Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Bugs and feature requests should be reported on `s2s-ai-challenge` gitlab [issue tracker](https://renkulab.io/gitlab/aaron.spring/s2s-ai-challenge/-/issues/new?issuable_template=bug)


# Merge Requests

Checklist:

- MRs should include a short, descriptive title.
- Small improvements need not reference an issue, but PRs that introduce larger changes or add new functionality should refer to an issue.
- Structure your commits in meaningful units, each with an understandable purpose and coherent commit message. For example, if your proposed changes contain a refactoring and a new feature, make two PRs.

## Steps

### 1. Fork this `s2s-ai-challenge-template` repository [https://renkulab.io/gitlab/aaron.spring/s2s-ai-challenge-template](https://renkulab.io/gitlab/aaron.spring/s2s-ai-challenge-template).

### 2. Clone your fork locally using `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, connect your repository
   to the upstream (main project), and create a branch:

```bash
git clone https://renkulab.io/gitlab/$YOURNAME/s2s-ai-challenge-template.git
cd s2s-ai-challenge-template
git remote add upstream https://renkulab.io/gitlab/aaron.spring/s2s-ai-challenge-template.git
```

### 3. To fix a bug or add feature create your own branch off "master":

```bash
git checkout -b your-bugfix-feature-branch-name master
```

If you need some help with Git, follow this quick start
`guide <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/QuickStart>`_.

### 4. Install dependencies into a new conda environment::

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml  # rename name: "base" to name: "s2s-ai"
conda activate "s2s-ai"
```

Now you have an environment called ``s2s-ai`` that you can work in.
Youâ€™ll need to make sure to activate that environment next time you want
to use it after closing the terminal or your system.

### 5. Break your edits up into reasonably sized commits::

```bash
git commit -a -m "<commit message>"
git push -u
```

### 6. Create a new changelog entry in ``CHANGELOG.md``:

The entry should be entered as: tbd

<description> (``:pr:`#<pull request number>```) ```<author's names>`_``

where ``<description>`` is the description of the PR related to the change and
``<pull request number>`` is the pull request number and ``<author's names>`` are your first
and last names.

Add yourself to list of authors at the end of ``CHANGELOG.md`` file if not there yet, in
alphabetical order.

### 7. Open your MR on renkulab.io/gitlab under [https://renkulab.io/gitlab/aaron.spring/s2s-ai-challenge-template/-/merge_requests](https://renkulab.io/gitlab/aaron.spring/s2s-ai-challenge-template/-/merge_requests).

- Document your MR
- List closing issues
- Add references
- Show improvement
   
### 8. Your MR will be review and eventually merged by a maintainer.
